# API Integration Documentation

## Overview

This React app has been transformed from using dummy data to working with a backend Express API. The backend runs on port 8001.

## Changes Made

### 1. API Service (`src/services/api.js`)

- Created a centralized API service to handle all backend communication
- Implements authentication token management using localStorage
- Provides methods for all CRUD operations on tasks and user authentication
- Base URL: `http://127.0.0.1:8001/api/v1`

### 2. Authentication Flow

- **Login**: Uses `/auth/login` endpoint with email and password
- **Signup**: Uses `/auth/signup` endpoint with username, email, password, and password2
- **Token Management**: Automatically stores and uses JWT tokens for authenticated requests
- **Logout**: Clears stored token and resets authentication state

### 3. Task Management

- **Get All Tasks**: `GET /tasks/task` (requires authentication)
- **Get Single Task**: `GET /tasks/task/:id` (requires authentication)
- **Create Task**: `POST /tasks/task` with title, description, startDate, endDate
- **Update Task**: `PUT /tasks/task/:id` with task data including isCompleted status
- **Delete Task**: `DELETE /tasks/task/:id` (requires authentication)

### 4. Dashboard Integration

- **Dashboard Data**: `GET /tasks/dashboard` to fetch statistics
- Falls back to local task data if API call fails

### 5. Component Updates

#### App.jsx

- Removed dummy data (TEST_USER, INITIAL_TASKS)
- Added API service integration
- Implemented proper authentication state management
- Added task CRUD operations with API calls

#### Tasks.jsx

- Updated to use API data structure (title, endDate, isCompleted, \_id)
- Added delete functionality with confirmation
- Updated filtering logic for completed/in-progress tasks
- Added loading states for better UX

#### Createtasks.jsx

- Integrated with API createTask function
- Added proper error handling and success feedback
- Automatic navigation to tasks page after successful creation

#### EditTask.jsx

- Fetches task data from API using task ID
- Updated form to use API data structure
- Integrated with API updateTask function
- Added proper error handling

#### Dashboard.jsx

- Fetches dashboard statistics from API
- Falls back to local task data if API fails
- Shows real-time task statistics

#### Signin.jsx

- Integrated with API login function
- Proper error handling for authentication failures
- Token storage and management

#### Signup.jsx

- Integrated with API signup function
- Added loading states and error handling
- Automatic navigation to signin after successful registration

## API Endpoints Used

### Authentication

- `POST /auth/signup` - User registration
- `POST /auth/login` - User login
- `DELETE /auth/delete` - User deletion

### Tasks

- `GET /tasks/task` - Get all tasks
- `GET /tasks/task/:id` - Get single task
- `POST /tasks/task` - Create new task
- `PUT /tasks/task/:id` - Update task
- `DELETE /tasks/task/:id` - Delete task

### Dashboard

- `GET /tasks/dashboard` - Get dashboard statistics

## Data Structure Changes

### Task Object

**Before (Dummy Data):**

```javascript
{
  name: "Task name",
  date: "2024-03-15",
  status: "inProgress"
}
```

**After (API Data):**

```javascript
{
  _id: "task_id",
  title: "Task title",
  description: "Task description",
  startDate: "2024-03-15",
  endDate: "2024-03-20",
  isCompleted: false
}
```

## Error Handling

- All API calls include proper error handling
- User-friendly error messages displayed to users
- Console logging for debugging purposes
- Graceful fallbacks when API calls fail

## Security

- JWT tokens stored in localStorage
- Automatic token inclusion in authenticated requests
- Token cleanup on logout
- Proper authentication checks for protected routes

## Usage

1. Ensure the backend server is running on port 8001
2. Start the React development server
3. Register a new account or login with existing credentials
4. Create, view, edit, and delete tasks through the UI
5. View dashboard statistics

## Notes

- The app now requires a running backend server
- All dummy data has been removed
- Authentication is now real and persistent
- Task data is stored and retrieved from the backend
- The UI remains the same but now works with real data
